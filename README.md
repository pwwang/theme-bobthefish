# bobthefish

`bobthefish` is a Powerline-style, Git-aware [fish][fish] theme optimized for awesome.

[Original README](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-bobthefish)

## What's different

- Support of `$PWD2` that keeps symbolic links in the path (see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/pwwang/5ad96bbfb034a91af851c411f0b12a23)).
- New theme: `bright` (see the figure below)
- Awareness of `conda` environments

## New options

- `theme_newline_leading`: Different from `theme_newline_cursor`, you will have `> ` (or similar power font) as leading character.
